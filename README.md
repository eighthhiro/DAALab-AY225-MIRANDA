# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains coursework and laboratory exercises for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `/activities`
Contains past Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) activities and assignments completed throughout the course.

### `/LabWork1`
**Classic vs Optimized Bubble Sort Comparison**

A GUI-based application that compares the performance between classic bubble sort (always performs n-1 passes) and optimized bubble sort (exits early when no swaps occur). Includes detailed statistics on execution time and pass count.

### `/LabWork2`
**Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis**

A comprehensive sorting algorithm analyzer that compares three fundamental sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort (O(n²))
- Insertion Sort (O(n²))
- Merge Sort (O(n log n))

Demonstrates the significant performance gap between simple sorts and divide-and-conquer approaches.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each lab work folder contains its own README with specific instructions for running the programs.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## 📝 Note

All sorting algorithms are implemented manually (no built-in `.sort()` functions) to demonstrate actual algorithmic performance differences.
